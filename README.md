# 🔥 Divi Meme Burn Address Generator

This tool generates **valid, Base58Check-encoded Divi addresses** that start with fun or meme-worthy prefixes like:

- `D1337`
- `D1E`
- `DBURN`
- ...or any other prefix starting with `D`

These addresses are **valid**, **accepted by Divi Core**, but **forever unspendable** — perfect for burning coins as a joke, protest, or art.

## ⚠️ WARNING: THIS IS A NOVELTY PROJECT ANY COINS SENT TO ANY ADDRESSES IS LOST FOREVER

> **DO NOT USE THIS FOR REAL VALUE TRANSFERS YOU INTEND TO SPEND LATER.**

This is a **burn tool**. All addresses generated by this script are:

- **Not derived from a real private/public key pair**
- **Mathematically unspendable**
- **Provably irrecoverable**
- **For meme burns only**

### ✅ If you send funds to these addresses:
- They **will be destroyed**
- No one, including you, will ever be able to recover them
- That’s the whole point

## 💡 How It Works

This script:

1. Uses random 20-byte values (not real pubkeys)
2. Prepends the Divi version byte (`0x1e`, for `D`)
3. Appends a valid 4-byte checksum
4. Encodes the result in **Base58Check**
5. Checks if it matches your desired prefix (`D1337`, `D1E`, `DBURN`, etc.)

No private keys are involved. No keys are generated. No keys are stored.

This creates **provably unspendable but valid Divi addresses**.
